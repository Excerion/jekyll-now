## Introduction

New Moon is a new type of format that tries to eliminate luck as a factor. You play with a 20-card pre-built deck and draw the entire deck at the beginning. There's no draw phases or hand limit; you just try to play your cards in the right order.

The first iteration uses [this deck](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=2551996).
