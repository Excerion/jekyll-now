## Abstract
The idea is to start with the most skill-promoting cards I can find, and have those as benchmarks, so nothing objectively stronger than those is allowed, and people are forced to play those cards.

What makes a card skill-promoting? It must encourage decision-making, so things that can be used in multiple ways are skill-promoting, like Enemy Controller. Also, the aspect of improvisation is important. Therefore there should be few recruiters and cards that let you take control of the opponentâ€™s stuff is encouraged.
