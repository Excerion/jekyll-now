## Introduction
Welcome to Ace format, a Yu-Gi-Oh! format that focuses on simple, linear decks. It includes cards that are simple, straightforward, and promote decision-making, like Slate Warrior and Enemy Controller. It also excludes cards that are objectively stronger than the most skill-promoting cards, to avoid their power being inflated. This format uses some custom rules that reduce the factor of luck.

## Rules
Master Rules 1 are in effect, with the following exceptions:

* The minimum deck size is 20 cards
* A deck cannot include more than 2 copies of any card
* Players start with 6 cards in their hands (and draw to 7 on the first turn)
* If a player decks out, they shuffle their GY into their deck and continue playing as normally.
