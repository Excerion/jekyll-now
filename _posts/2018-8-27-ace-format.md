## Abstract

The idea is to start with the most skill-promoting cards I can find, and have those as benchmarks, so nothing objectively stronger than those is allowed, and people are forced to play those cards.

What makes a card skill-promoting? It must encourage decision-making, so things that can be used in multiple ways are skill-promoting, like Enemy Controller. Also, the aspect of improvisation is important. Therefore there should be few recruiters and cards that let you take control of the opponent’s stuff is encouraged.

## Ideas

### Benchmark rewards
* Toy Magician bait -- the problem is that if it's the strongest LV4, you will never want to set it anyway.
* Ohka Tribute Summon -- Yes.
* Sand Moth bait -- Yes.
* Slate Warrior flip -- Yes.

### Skill-involving plays
* Baiting Ohka, then using Autonomous Action Unit on it.
* Widespread Ruin vs. Forbidden Lance. It also modifies the ATK, so Ruin will just destroy a different monster.
