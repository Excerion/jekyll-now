I'd like to talk about my Blade Knight deck.

So why this list? The point is to get the most out of Blade Knight. You want to consistently
* have Blade Knight as your only monster, and
* have 1 or fewer cards in your hand.

In previous builds, I played 1x Electric Snake and 1x Regenerating Zombie to answer Duo. However, in this build I'm using a different solution. Since you want to power up Blade Knight anyway, I've decided to try to have 1 cards in hand as much as possible, so the opponent will not gain advantage from Duo. You will only be vulnerable if your opponent opens, and they have Duo in their opening hand. This is acceptable.

This would entail that you do not get more than 2 monsters at the same time, and that is how this deck is designed. With only 10 monsters, there is bu a 15.28% chance that you open with 3 or more monsters. So most of the time, you summon 1 monster, set 4 backrows, and end.

This explains 3x Solemn and 2x Fake Trap, in case the opponent has Heavy Storm. It may not be very appealing to pay 4000 to negate Heavy, but it's acceptable. You are going to want to set your spells as well (to evade Duo), so that's why there's a heavier emphasis on Solemn than on Fake Trap. You can use Prohibition as an alternative as well.

So this deck runs very few monsters, but your one for one traps are only going to win you the game if you can maintain field presence. That's why it has 2x rota and 3x Embodiment of Apophis. It may not seem particularly powerful, but it makes the deck more consistent. And it can do a couple of nice things. If your opponent gets rid of your monster in their turn, you can activate Apophis and all of a sudden you have a wall that saves your life points before attacking next turn. It's quite useful to have guaranteed field presence without having to overextend beforehand.
