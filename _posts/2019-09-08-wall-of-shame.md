## Wall of Shame

For a while now, there's been an influx of new players in the goat section of Duelingbook. This has a positive side, in that the community can grow this way, but the downside is that many of them are toxic. There are a few ways of addressing that problem. A solution many are turning to is to only play with their friends or ranked on one of the Discord servers, so as to avoid these players altogether. This is an approach I don't like, because potentially good and friendly players will be stuck dueling the other players who aren't part of any community, so they'll have lower quality duels and might lose interest in Goat format before ever getting exposed to any community. The approach is akin to a whitelist, where people get filtered out by default, and only if you've happened to stumble upon a community are you getting through the filter. What I instead propose is a blacklist approach: give everyone a fair chance, and when someone is being toxic will they get on a public list of people to avoid. I've had many great duels by playing against so-called randoms.

I had started compiling this Wall of Shame, only to discover that someone else, namely KL1993, had done it before me. They say that great minds think alike. What follows is a verbatim copy of his profile text.

But before that, I'd like to clarify what I mean by a toxic player. It includes people who:
* are stubborn about rulings even when facing experienced players, contradicting established rulings even when you send them a link as evidence,
* quit while you're explaining how something is ruled,
* are rude,
* try to cheat.

On the other hand, it's absolutely okay if someone:
* is bad at goat format (we've all been there once),
* doesn't know the rulings, but asks how it works and trusts their opponent (or the links they send),
* leaves after game 1.

That's not a precise definition, but you get the picture. Only those people should be on the list. And while I didn't make the list myself, I know KL1993 and trust his judgment. Without further ado, here's a copy:

> I'm tired of nooby/rude/unsportive player so i'm gonna make here a little list of this kind of person just for reminding myself i should avoid them. If someone go on my profil also, it can't hurt to know who avoid.
