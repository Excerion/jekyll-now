New Moon is a new type of format that tries to eliminate luck as a factor. It's like chess played with Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. You use a 20-card pre-built deck, draw everything at the beginning, and try to play your cards in the right order. Truly a new way to play the game.

## The rules
* The regular Yu-Gi-Oh! rules are applied except for the following rules.
* Both players use the same 20-card pre-built deck.
* All cards are drawn at the beginning of the game.
* There is no draw phase or hand limit.

## Quick start
To get started:
* Find an opponent and agree on an iteration.
	* [This](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=2654821) is the currently recommended iteration.
* Study the deck for a bit.
* Enter a game with it in unlimited and type /draw 10 in the duel to draw your deck faster.
