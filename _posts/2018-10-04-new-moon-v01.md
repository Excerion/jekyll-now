New Moon is a new type of format that tries to eliminate luck as a factor. It's like chess played with Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. You use a 20-card pre-built deck, draw everything at the beginning, and try to play your cards in the right order. Truly a new way to play the game.

## The rules
* The regular Yu-Gi-Oh! rules are applied except for the following rules.
* Both players use the same 20-card pre-built deck.
* All cards are drawn at the beginning of the game.
* There is no draw phase or hand limit.
* There are different iterations with their own decks.
	* [Iteration 1](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=2551996).
	* [Iteration 2](https://www.duelingbook.com/deck?id=2555419).
